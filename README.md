# Magic Tournament Tracker

Created by Matthew, James, and Manny

This PWA allows Magic the Gathering Players to track their results and creates graphs allowing them to visiualize their win rates across different matchups. This app fills a need for compeititve Magic players who currently do not have an easy way to track and view data from in person events. It also provides utility to non competitive players through the life counter and card search features. 

As a compeititve Magic player myself who has previously tracked my wins and losses on paper before plugging them into an excel sheet later, I see a lot of value in this app. It lets magic players focus more on the game and less on the stat tracking.
